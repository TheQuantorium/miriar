## License

This repository stores both the Miriar *specification*, and a Rust implementation of the specification, which have different licenses. The specification and all related materials stored in the `specification/` directory are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), available [here](https://github.com/TheQuantorium/miriar/blob/main/specification/LICENSE-CC-BY). The Rust implementation of the Miriar specification and all related materials stored in the `miriar-rs/` directory are licensed under the MIT license, available [here](https://github.com/TheQuantorium/miriar/blob/main/miriar-rs/LICENSE-MIT). This readme file pertains to both the specification and the implementation, and is licensed under the same [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) as the specification itself, which is available [here](https://github.com/TheQuantorium/miriar/blob/main/specification/LICENSE-CC-BY). All other files in this repository not mentioned thus far (e.g. the `.github/` folder) are licensed under the MIT license, available [here](https://github.com/TheQuantorium/miriar/blob/main/miriar-rs/LICENSE-MIT).

Any contributions to either component of this repository will be licensed according to the appropriate license as explained above, unless otherwise explicitly indicated, which may lead to different parts of a single contribution being licensed in two different ways, for example if a contribution alters both the specification and the implementation. Any contributions that create new folders or files in the root of this repository must explicitly state their licensing terms, and they must be specially reviewed by the Quantorium project.

*A brief, non-legal summary for users: if you're using `miriar-rs`, it's under the MIT license, but the specification is under a CC-BY 4.0 license, which you can read more about [here](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). This summary does not constitute a legal statement, and you should refer to the two licenses in this repository.*
